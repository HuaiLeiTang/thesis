abstract = {Traditional stereo systems often falter over changes in lighting between their two views. Unfortunately, such changes often occur when using stereo with a wide baseline or between images from different spectra. In this paper, we propose a new dense stereo correspondence similarity metric, mutual information, which has the potential to overcome such adverse conditions. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of this metric, both quantitatively and qualitatively, under a variety of conditions. Throughout the exploration, we compare mutual information to a more traditional cross-correlation stereo system. We show that mutual information performs under conditions in which traditional dense stereo fails.},

abstract = {We propose a new approach to the correspondence problem that makes use of non-parametric local transforms as the basis for correlation. Non-parametric local transforms rely on the relative ordering of local intensity values, and not on the intensity values themselves. Correlation using such transforms can tolerate a signi cant number of outliers. This can result in improved performance near object boundaries when compared with conventional methods such as normalized correlation. We introduce two non-parametric local transforms: the rank transform, which measures local intensity, and the census transform, which summarizes local image structure. We describe some properties of these transforms, and demonstrate their utility on both synthetic and real data.},

In this paper, we present two new methods which properly address occlusions, while preserv-ing the advantages of graph cut algorithms. We give experimental results for stereo as well as motion, which demonstrate that our methods perform well both at detecting occlusions and computing disparities.},

The scene structure is modeled by a set of planar surface patches which are estimated using a new technique that is more robust to outliers. Instead of assigning a disparity value to each pixel, a disparity plane is assigned to each segment. The optimal disparity plane labeling is approximated by applying belief propagation. Experimental results using the Middlebury stereo test bed demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method},

@article{Scharstein2007,
abstract = {State-of-the-art stereo vision algorithms utilize color changes as important cues for object boundaries. Most methods impose heuristic restrictions or priors on disparities, for example by modulating local smoothness costs with intensity gradients. In this paper we seek to replace such heuristics with explicit probabilistic models of disparities and intensities learned from real images. We have constructed a large number of stereo datasets with ground-truth disparities, and we use a subset of these datasets to learn the parameters of conditional random fields (CRFs). We present experimental results illustrating the potential of our approach for automatically learning the parameters of models with richer structure than standard hand-tuned MRF models.},

abstract = {We present a random field based model for stereo vision with explicit occlusion labeling in a probabilistic framework. The model employs non-parametric cost functions that can be learnt automatically using the structured support vector machine. The learning algorithm enables the training of models that are steered towards optimizing for a particular desired loss function, such as the metric used to evaluate the quality of the stereo labeling. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method surpasses that of previous learning approaches and is comparable to the state-of-the-art for pixel-based stereo. Moreover, our method achieves good results even when trained on different image sets, in contrast with the common practice of hand tuning to specific benchmark images. In addition, we investigate the impact of graph structure on model performance. Our study shows that random field models with longer-range edges generally outperform the 4-connected grid and that this advantage is especially pronounced for noisy images.},

abstract = {Deep networks have recently enjoyed enormous success when applied to recognition and classification problems in computer vision, but their use in graphics problems has been limited. In this work, we present a novel deep architecture that performs new view synthesis directly from pixels, trained from a large number of posed image sets. In contrast to traditional approaches which consist of multiple complex stages of processing, each of which require careful tuning and can fail in unexpected ways, our system is trained end-to-end. The pixels from neighboring views of a scene are presented to the network which then directly produces the pixels of the unseen view. The benefits of our approach include generality (we only require posed image sets and can easily apply our method to different domains), and high quality results on traditionally difficult scenes. We believe this is due to the end-to-end nature of our system which is able to plausibly generate pixels according to color, depth, and texture priors learnt automatically from the training data. To verify our method we show that it can convincingly reproduce known test views from nearby imagery. Additionally we show images rendered from novel viewpoints. To our knowledge, our work is the first to apply deep learning to the problem of new view synthesis from sets of real-world, natural imagery.},

abstract = {In this article, we tackle the problem of depth estimation from single monocular images. Compared with depth estimation using multiple images such as stereo depth perception, depth from monocular images is much more challenging. Prior work typically focuses on exploiting geometric priors or additional sources of information, most using hand-crafted features. Recently, there is mounting evidence that features from deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) set new records for various vision applications. On the other hand, considering the continuous characteristic of the depth values, depth estimations can be naturally formulated as a continuous conditional random field (CRF) learning problem. Therefore, here we present a deep convolutional neural field model for estimating depths from single monocular images, aiming to jointly explore the capacity of deep CNN and continuous CRF. In particular, we propose a deep structured learning scheme which learns the unary and pairwise potentials of continuous CRF in a unified deep CNN framework. We then further propose an equally effective model based on fully convolutional networks and a novel superpixel pooling method, which is {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$} times faster, to speedup the patch-wise convolutions in the deep model. With this more efficient model, we are able to design deeper networks to pursue better performance. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor scene datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art depth estimation approaches.},

abstract = {This paper presents a novel tree-based cost aggregation method for dense stereo matching. Instead of employing the minimum spanning tree (MST) and its variants, a new tree structure, ”Segment-Tree”, is proposed for non-local matching cost aggregation. Conceptually, the segment-tree is constructed in a three-step process: first, the pixels are grouped into a set of segments with the reference color or intensity image; second, a tree graph is created for each segment; and in the final step, these independent segmen- t graphs are linked to form the segment-tree structure. In practice, this tree can be efficiently built in time nearly lin- ear to the number of the image pixels. Compared to MST where the graph connectivity is determined with local edge weights, our method introduces some 'non-local' decision rules: the pixels in one perceptually consistent segment are more likely to share similar disparities, and therefore their connectivity within the segment should be first enforced in the tree construction process. The matching costs are then aggregated over the tree within two passes. Performance evaluation on 19 Middlebury data sets shows that the pro- posed method is comparable to previous state-of-the-art aggregation methods in disparity accuracy and processing speed. Furthermore, the tree structure can be refined with the estimated disparities, which leads to consistent scene segmentation and significantly better aggregation results.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a recursive implementation of the bilateral filter. Unlike previous methods, this implementation yields an bilateral filter whose computational complexity is linear in both input size and dimensionality. The proposed implementation demonstrates that the bilateral filter can be as efficient as the recent edge-preserving filtering methods, especially for high-dimensional images. Let the number of pixels contained in the image be N, and the number of channels be D, the computational complexity of the proposed implementation will be O(ND). It is more efficient than the state-of-the-art bilateral filtering methods that have a computational complexity of O(ND2) [1] (linear in the image size but polynomial in dimensionality) or O(Nlog(N)D) [2] (linear in the dimensionality thus faster than [1] for high-dimensional filtering). Specifically, the proposed implementation takes about 43 ms to process a one megapixel color image (and about 14 ms to process a 1 megapixel grayscale image) which is about 18 × faster than [1] and 86× faster than [2]. The experiments were conducted on a MacBook Air laptop computer with a 1.8 GHz Intel Core i7 CPU and 4 GB memory. The memory complexity of the proposed implementation is also low: as few as the image memory will be required (memory for the images before and after filtering is excluded). This paper also derives a new filter named gradient domain bilateral filter from the proposed recursive implementation. Unlike the bilateral filter, it performs bilateral filtering on the gradient domain. It can be used for edge-preserving filtering but avoids sharp edges that are observed to cause visible artifacts in some computer graphics tasks. The proposed implementations were proved to be effective for a number of computer vision and computer graphics applications, including stylization, tone mapping, detail enhancement and stereo matching.},

abstract = {This paper describes the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) stereo method. It uses a pixelwise, Mutual Information based matching cost for compensating radiometric differences of input images. Pixelwise matching is supported by a smoothness constraint that is usually expressed as a global cost function. SGM performs a fast approximation by pathwise optimizations from all directions. The discussion also addresses occlusion detection, subpixel refinement and multi-baseline matching. Additionally, postprocessing steps for removing outliers, recovering from specific problems of structured environments and the interpolation of gaps are presented. Finally, strategies for processing almost arbitrarily large images and fusion of disparity images using orthographic projection are proposed.A comparison on standard stereo images shows that SGM is among the currently top-ranked algorithms and is best, if subpixel accuracy is considered. The complexity is linear to the number of pixels and disparity range, which results in a runtime of just 1-2s on typical test images. An in depth evaluation of the Mutual Information based matching cost demonstrates a tolerance against a wide range of radiometric transformations. Finally, examples of reconstructions from huge aerial frame and pushbroom images demonstrate that the presented ideas are working well on practical problems.},

abstract = {Common local stereo methods match support windows at integer-valued disparities. The implicit assumption that pixels within the support region have constant disparity does not hold for slanted surfaces and leads to a bias towards reconstructing frontoparallel surfaces. This work overcomes this bias by estimating an individual 3D plane at each pixel onto which the support region is projected. The major challenge of this approach is to find a pixels optimal 3D plane among all possible planes whose number is infinite. We show that an ideal algorithm to solve this problem is PatchMatch 1 that we extend to find an approximate nearest neighbor according to a plane. In addition to Patch- Matchs spatial propagation scheme, we propose (1) view propagation where planes are propagated among left and right views of the stereo pair and (2) temporal propagation where planes are propagated from preceding and consecutive frames of a video when doing temporal stereo. Adaptive support weights are used in matching cost aggregation to improve results at disparity borders. We also show that our slanted support windows can be used to compute a cost volume for global stereo methods, which allows for explicit treatment of occlusions and can handle large untextured regions. In the results we demonstrate that our method reconstructs highly slanted surfaces and achieves impressive disparity details with sub-pixel precision. In the Middlebury table, our method is currently top-performer among local methods and takes rank 2 among approximately 110 competitors if sub-pixel precision is considered.},

abstract = {In recent years, local stereo matching algorithms have again become very popular in the stereo community. This is mainly due to the introduction of adaptive support weight algorithms that can for the first time produce results that are on par with global stereo methods. The crux in these adaptive support weight methods is to assign an individual weight to each pixel within the support window. Adaptive support weight algorithms differ mainly in the manner in which this weight computation is carried out. In this paper we present an extensive evaluation study. We evaluate the performance of various methods for computing adaptive support weights including the original bilateral filter-based weights, as well as more recent approaches based on geodesic distances or on the guided filter. To obtain reliable findings, we test these different weight functions on a large set of 35 ground truth disparity pairs. We have implemented all approaches on the GPU, which allows for a fair comparison of run time on modern hardware platforms. Apart from the standard local matching using fronto-parallel windows, we also embed the competing weight functions into the recent PatchMatch Stereo approach, which uses slanted sub-pixel windows and represents a state-of-the-art local algorithm. In the final part of the paper, we aim at shedding light on general points of adaptive support weight matching, which, for example, includes a discussion about symmetric versus asymmetric support weight approaches. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {Human beings process stereoscopic correspondence across multiple scales. However, this bio-inspiration is ignored by state-of-the-art cost aggregation methods for dense stereo correspondence. In this paper, a generic cross-scale cost aggregation framework is proposed to al- low multi-scale interaction in cost aggregation. We firstly reformulate cost aggregation from a unified optimization perspective and show that different cost aggregation meth- ods essentially differ in the choices of similarity kernels. Then, an inter-scale regularizer is introduced into optimiza- tion and solving this new optimization problem leads to the proposed framework. Since the regularization term is inde- pendent of the similarity kernel, various cost aggregation methods can be integrated into the proposed general frame- work. We show that the cross-scale framework is important as it effectively and efficiently expands state-of-the-art cost aggregation methods and leads to significant improvements, when evaluated on Middlebury, KITTI and New Tsukuba datasets. 1.},

@article{Hosni2013a,
abstract = {Many computer vision tasks can be formulated as labeling problems. The desired solution is often a spatially smooth labeling where label transitions are aligned with color edges of the input image. We show that such solutions can be efficiently achieved by smoothing the label costs with a very fast edge preserving filter. In this paper we propose a generic and simple framework comprising three steps: (i) constructing a cost volume (ii) fast cost volume filtering and (iii) winner-take-all label selection. Our main contribution is to show that with such a simple framework state-of-the-art results can be achieved for several computer vision applications. In particular, we achieve (i) disparity maps in real-time, whose quality exceeds those of all other fast (local) approaches on the Middlebury stereo benchmark, and (ii) optical flow fields with very fine structures as well as large displacements. To demonstrate robustness, the few parameters of our framework are set to nearly identical values for both applications. Also, competitive results for interactive image segmentation are presented. With this work, we hope to inspire other researchers to leverage this framework to other application areas.},

In this paper we evaluate the insensitivity of different matching costs with respect to radiometric variations of the input images. We consider both pixel-based and window-based variants and measure their performance in the presence of global intensity changes (e.g., due to gain and exposure differences), local intensity changes (e.g., due to vignetting, non-Lambertian surfaces, and varying lighting), and noise. Using existing stereo datasets with ground-truth disparities as well as six new datasets taken under controlled changes of exposure and lighting, we evaluate the different costs with a local, a semi-global, and a global stereo method.},

abstract = {This paper considers the objectives of accurate stereo matching, especially at object boundaries, robustness against recording or illumination changes and efficiency of the calculation. These objectives lead to the proposed Semi- GlobalMatching method that performs pixelwise matching based on Mutual Information and the approximation of a global smoothness constraint. Occlusions are detected and disparities determined with sub-pixel accuracy. Addition- ally, an extension for multi-baseline stereo images is pre- sented. There are two novel contributions. Firstly, a hierar- chical calculation ofMutual Information based matching is shown, which is almost as fast as intensity based matching. Secondly, an approximation of a global cost calculation is proposed that can be performed in a time that is linear to the number of pixels and disparities. The implementation requires just 1 second on typical images.},
